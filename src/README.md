## Git Branch Naming Convention

### Code Flow Branches

âž– Development (dev)

All new features and bug fixes should be brought to the development branch.

âž– QA/Test (test)

Contains all codes ready for QA testing.

âž– Staging (staging, Optional)

It contains tested features that the stakeholders wanted to be available either for a demo or a proposal before elevating into production.

âž– Master (master)

The production branch, if the repository is published, is the default branch being presented.

### Temporary Branches

#### âž– Feature

Any code changes for a new module or use case should be done on a feature branch. This branch is created based on the current development branch. When all changes are Done, a Pull Request/Merge Request is needed to put all of these to the development branch.

Examples

feature/AZURE-1234

feature/AZURE-5678

#### âž– Bug Fix

If the code changes made from the feature branch were rejected after a release, sprint or demo, any necessary fixes after that should be done on the bugfix branch.

Examples

bugfix/AZURE-1234

bugfix/AZURE-5678

#### âž– Hot Fix
If there is a need to fix a blocker, do a temporary patch, or apply a critical framework or configuration change that should be handled immediately, it should be created as a Hotfix. It does not follow the scheduled integration of code and could be merged directly to the production branch and then into the development branch later.

Examples

hotfix/disable-endpoint-zero-day-exploit

hotfix/increase-scaling-threshold

#### âž– Experimental
Any new feature or idea that is not part of a release or a sprint. A branch for playing around.

Examples

experimental/dark-theme-support

#### âž– Build
A branch specifically for creating specific build artifacts or for doing code coverage runs.

Examples

build/azure-metric

#### âž– Release
A branch for tagging a specific release version.

Examples

release/app-1.0.0

#### âž– Merging
A temporary branch for resolving merge conflicts, usually between the latest development and a feature or Hotfix branch. This can also be used if two branches of a feature being worked on by multiple developers need to be merged, verified, and finalized.

Examples

merge/dev_lombok-refactoring

merge/combined-device-support

## MongoDB Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names. Use camelCase for multi-word names. Avoid using MongoDB reserved words.
